For Extract to work, and all that follows, you will need to save the following JSON results to file.

#### https://itch.io/bundle/520/games.json
#### https://itch.io/bundle/902/games.json
#### https://itch.io/bundle/1316/games.json

#### IMPORTANT - Save them with the exact following names.
---------
#### 520_games.json
#### 902_games.json
#### 1316_games.json

Once you have saved those files to your PC (Windows only), then you will need to modify the paths for them in the 'Settings.ini' file. Use a text editor like Notepad. Once you do that, then you can use the 'Extract' option.

Once 'Extract' has finished, run the 'Bundle Compare' program again, and it will convert the results into a TAB delimited file, which will then display in an Array Viewer. At this point you can sort by title or not.

Subsequent runs of the program, will give you more sort and filter (limit) view options.
