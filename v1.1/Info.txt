
For Extract to work, and all that follows, you will need to save the following JSON results to file.

https://itch.io/bundle/520/games.json
https://itch.io/bundle/902/games.json
https://itch.io/bundle/1316/games.json

IMPORTANT - Save them with the exact following names.
---------
520_games.json
902_games.json
1316_games.json

Once you have saved those files to your PC (Windows only), then you will need to modify the paths for them in the 'Settings.ini' file. Use a text editor like Notepad. Once you do that, then you can use the 'Extract' option.

Once 'Extract' has finished, run the 'Bundle Compare' program again, and it will convert the results into a TAB delimited file, which will then display in an Array Viewer. At this point you can sort by title or not.

Subsequent runs of the program, will give you more sort and filter (limit) view options.


HISTORY
-------

(v1.1)
Added a View Options window and choices. The 'Ukraine' bundle is now called 'Ukraine Assist', to help with sorting and the limit filter. Sort and Limit results can now be saved to file, both as unsorted and sorted (_saved.tsv). Added support to view the TAB delimited files with another program (it may require the '.tsv' extension to be associated with that program, i.e. Microsoft Works Spreadsheet).
